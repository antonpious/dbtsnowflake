# use this file for providing the alias names for 
# each of the transformation file
# this way the table or view need not be only based on the file name
# the data_tests would automatically generate the test files for 
# not null and unique using the column name automatically
# without having to write these tests our selves
# the test execution is done by the same run syntax with just the test
